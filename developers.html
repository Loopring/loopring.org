                     <h1>Developer Portal</h1>

                    <p>This developer portal provides technical information for software engineers
                        and product managers to comprehend and adopt the solution. We welcome our
                        community to send us feedback to enhance these documents.</p>
                     <h2 data-anchor="AboutLoopring">Loopring</h2>

                    <p>Loopring is a layer-2 protocol that consists of multiple smart contracts
                        to verify tradable orders and perform per-trade settlement on-chain while
                        keeping all order management off-chain. Loopring features a more generic
                        design with matching-as-a-service, ring-matching, and dual-authoring technologies.
                        We strongly encourage you to read our <a href="https://github.com/Loopring/whitepaper/raw/master/en_whitepaper.pdf">new whitepaper</a> and
                        previous <a target="_blank" href="http://medium.com/loopring-protocol">blog posts</a> as
                        it is the best way to understand the protocol. If you have any questions,
                        you can send us an <a href="mailto:foundation@loopring.org">email</a>, or
                        post questions on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/c/loopring" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> or
                        <a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. You can also learn more about the Loopring Protocol <a href="protocol.html">here</a>.</p>

                    data-anchor="OurSolution">Our Solution</h2>
                        <p>There is a significant lack of security, transparency, and liquidity in
                            centralized exchanges. Loopring invented a whole new trading experience
                            built upon blockchain and smart contract technologies. Through our whitepaper
                            and this developer portal, you will see that Loopring DEXs are non-custodial
                            and perfectly secure; all trades are verified and recorded on the blockchain
                            for absolute transparency, and every Loopring order can be shared with
                            as many parties as possible with no trust needed, which also makes for
                            higher liquidity and a better trade price.</p>
                        <p>The Loopring Foundation provides open-sourced, ready-to-deploy solutions
                            for our community to develop the DEX frontend with apps (a.k.a wallets),
                            the DEX backend (a.k.a relayers or match-engines), along with liquidity
                            sharing middleware. We also provide free-of-charge consulting and technical
                            support.</p>
                        <p>We have multiple patents in the US, the European Union, and China to protect
                            the design and implementation of the Loopring Protocol. Before deploying
                            a trading protocol on any public blockchain, please make sure your smart
                            contracts don't include the ring-matching and dual-authoring features;
                            otherwise, you must obtain our formal authorization for using our patents
                            in writing.</p>
                         <h2 data-anchor="Challenges">Challenges</h2>

                        <p>All DEX solutions suffer low TPS (transactions per second) and long block-time
                            imposed by the underlying blockchains. Ethereum's current TPS is about
                            15 and block-time is roughly 15 seconds. Without a higher TPS, Loopring's
                            trading experience won't be a match for centralized exchanges; but once
                            Ethereum's TPS scales to 1000 or above, we believe the overall DEX trading
                            experience will even better than centralized exchanges.</p>
                        <p>Loopring and all DEX protocols are not designed for high-frequency trading.
                            This is not an issue at all, as we believe high-frequency trading is not
                            fair for regular traders and has been dramatically misused for market manipulation
                            of crypto prices.</p>
                         <h2 data-anchor="VsKyberNetwork">Loopring vs. Kyber Network</h2>

                        <p>Loopring and Kyber are designed for different use cases and are complementary
                            to each other. Loopring features third-party matching-as-a-service (MAAS)
                            whereas Kyber is a market-making protocol where market-makers offer their
                            clients liquidity at promised prices within a given period. Kyber is more
                            comparable to the Bancor protocol.</p>
                         <h2 data-anchor="Vs0x">Loopring vs. 0x</h2>

                        <p>Loopring and 0x are both order-based exchange protocols. We share many
                            common designs, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Both protocols enable order-based trading of ERC-20 tokens;</li>
                            <li>Orders are managed off-chain, but settlement transactions are performed
                                on-chain through smart contracts;</li>
                            <li>Both protocols suffer low TPS and long block-time of the underlying Ethereum
                                blockchain;</li>
                            <li>Both teams are very open and supportive.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>But we are also very different in many other ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Loopring's order model is much simpler and more generalized - one unidirectional
                                model fits all; whereas 0x has maker orders and taker orders;</li>
                            <li>Loopring features a ring-style matching that can put more than two orders
                                in a ring for higher liquidity and a better price. Ring-matching is a more
                                generalized trading scheme than the trading pair notation that is used
                                by 0x;</li>
                            <li>Loopring's Dual-Authoring technology prevents its orders and rings from
                                being stolen by middlemen and Ethereum miners; it also adds another level
                                of control for liquidity/order sharing;</li>
                            <li>Loopring offers a lot more open-sourced software for its partners to quickly
                                build a DEX at a smaller cost, including a JavaScript library, two web-based
                                wallet/DEX's, an embeddable HTML5 component for mobile apps, an iOS wallet
                                application, a distributed relay cluster with ring-matching capability,
                                and a liquidity sharing middleware based on pub-sub messaging;</li>
                            <li>Loopring will continue to focus on ERC-20 and will not support ERC-721
                                (non-fungible) tokens; whereas 0x aims to become the protocol for trading
                                everything. We believe a protocol needs to be simple, elegant, easy to
                                understand, and extensible.</li>

                         <h1>How to use Loopring?</h1>

                        <p>Unlike the rigid business model of centralized exchanges, Loopring's technology
                            offers you the ability to become part of the decentralized exchange ecosystem.
                            Let's take a look at the Loopring DEX ecosystem illustrated by the image
                            below:</p>
                        <img class="animateMe2" src="images/developers/ecosystem.png"
                        alt="Loopring Ecosystem">
                         <h2 data-anchor="DEX">Become a DEX or a Wallex</h2>

                        <p>Loopring can turn any application or web page into a DEX. A DEX retrieves
                            and displays orders and trades and may show submit-order and cancel-order
                            forms for users to manage their trading data. In our model, a DEX does
                            not have access to users' private keys. If it does, we then call it a Wallex
                            (Wallet + DEX). Orders generated by a DEX must be signed from within a
                            wallet app such as Ledger Nano before being sent to a relayer.</p>
                        <p>The Loopring team provides an open-sourced DEX named Circulr and an open-sourced
                            Wallex named Loopr. You can clone one of these projects to launch a web
                            frontend easily for accessing Loopring's default relayer system. If you
                            want to start from scratch, we also offer a JavaScript library called loopring.js
                            for you to access any compatible backend relayer system.</p>
                        <p>Loopring brings a new stream of income to DEX's and Wallex's- 20% of matching
                            fees will be rewarded to a DEX that helps users generate their orders.
                            This portion of fees will be automatically transferred to each DEX and
                            Wallex's fee-collecting address by the Loopring Protocol after each trade
                            has been settled, guaranteed!</p>
                        <p>Frontends have the option to connect to one or multiple relayers, given
                            that permission is granted. In the graph above, "Frontend 8" connects to
                            only one dedicated relayer. This is more like the centralized exchange
                            mode where liquidity is not shared, and there is a single point of relayer
                            failure; "Frontend 7" connects to one dedicated relayer while also shares
                            large orders to "Relayer D" to speed up trading; "Frontend 5" always broadcasts
                            orders to "Relay D" and "Relay C" to maximize trading speed and minimize
                            price spread; and "Frontend 3" evenly shares liquidity across two liquidity-sharing
                            networks through "Relay B"and "Relay C".</p>
                        <p>Connecting and broadcasting users' orders to multiple relayers and the
                            liquidity-sharing networks increase the likelihood of orders being fulfilled.
                            The network topologies and business relations between frontends, relayers,
                            and the liquidity-sharing networks are entirely up to each entity in the
                            ecosystem; the Loopring Foundation doesn't impose any rules. For more information
                            regarding DEX and Wallex, check out the <a href="frontends.html">Frontends</a> page.</p>
                        <p>If you are not happy with only 20% profit sharing, you can also run your
                            relayer cluster.</p>
                         <h2 data-anchor="Relayer">Become a Relayer</h2>

                        <p>Relayers manage orders and trades, and offer the non-custodial order-matching
                            services as options. Relayers can receive orders from as many frontends
                            as possible without trusting any of them. This opens the door to build
                            an even bigger liquidity pool than any centralized exchange.</p>
                        <p>Relayers get 80% of matching fees, but it doesn't come for free - Relayers
                            have to pay Ether as gas for ring-settlement transactions on Ethereum and
                            pay fiat money for cloud service.</p>
                        <p>For more information about Relayers, check out the <a href="relayers.html">Relayers</a> page.</p>
                        <h2
                        data-anchor="Liquidity">Sharing Liquidity</h2>
                            <p>Besides liqudity sharing among different frontends using the same relayer,
                                relayers can also share liquidity with each other by joining the same liquidity
                                sharing network. The Loopring Foundation provides a pub-sub based implementation
                                of such a network, but ecosystem partners can build their liquidity sharing
                                network with their technology stack of choice - the Loopring Protocol does
                                not have a standard for liquidity sharing.</p>
                            <p>Each liquidity-sharing network may have their own internal economic model
                                to incentivize order producers and charge orderers, which is not part of
                                the Loopring Protocol.</p>
