                        the loopring protocol. This document describes the functionalities they

                                <p class="animateMe2">To understand what the LSC does, we must first take a look at the definition
                                    of an order, the available actions for the user, and how the current order
                                    state is tracked.</p>

                                <p class="animateMe2">An order is a pack of data that describes the intent of the user on the
                                    market. To ensure the origin of the order, it is signed against the hash
                                    of its parameters with the user's private key. The signature is sent alongside
                                    the order on the network. This requires the order to stay immutable during
                                    its whole lifetime to verify the sender's address.</p>
                                <p class="animateMe2">Signature = ECDSA(SHA3(order_params))</p>
                                <p class="animateMe2">Even if the order never changes, the LSC has the possibility to <a target="_blank"

                                    <stron>Unidirectional Order Model</stron>, or UDOM for short. To learn more about

                                <p class="animateMe2">The exchange rate r of the order is determined using the following formula
                                    r = amountS/amountB. When a miner does the ring-matching there is a possibility
                                    that he finds you a better rate that gets you more tokenB than the amountB
                                    you specified. But, if the buyNoMoreThanAmountB flag is set, the LSC will
                                    make sure that you still get exactly amountB of tokenB.</p>
                                <p class="animateMe2 example">Example: with amountS = 10 and amountB = 2, r = 10/2 = 5. This means that
                                    you are willing to sell 5 tokenS for each tokenB. The miner does the ring-matching
                                    and finds you a rate of 4, topping the amount he could get you to 2.5 tokensB
                                    instead of 2. You only wanted 2 tokensB and set the buyNoMoreThanAmountB
                                    flag to true. The LSC takes that into consideration and still makes the
                                    transaction at a rate of 4 and you ended up selling 4 tokenS for each tokenB,
                                    effectively saving 2 tokenS. Keep in mind that this does not take into
                                    account the miner fees.</p>

                                    to the LSC, containing the details about the order and the amounts to cancel.
                                    The LSC will take that into account, store the amounts to cancel and emit
                                    an OrderCancelled event to the network.</p>

                                    <p class="animateMe2">The LSC expect to receive order rings from the miners. An order ring is
                                        multiple orders linked together in a way that allows them to be all matched
                                        at their desired exchange rate or better. See the diagram below as an example.</p>

                                        <p class="animateMe2">Notice how each order's token to sell is the following order's token to
                                            buy. It creates a loop that allows each order to effectively sell and buy
                                            their desired tokens without having a matching order of the opposite pair.</p>

                                        class="animateMe2">A ring is said to be valid when all the transactions can be made at an
                                            exchange rate equal or better than the original one specified by the user.
                                            To verify the ring validity, the product of the original exchange rates
                                            of all orders should be equal to or greater than 1.</p>

                                                    still has to verify what the miner supplied for these values. This is done
                                                    by miners for two main reasons: solidity does not have support for floating
                                                    point maths, especially pow(x, 1/n) and it is desired that the computation

                                                    zero-risk covered interest arbitrage. This is considered unfair conduct
