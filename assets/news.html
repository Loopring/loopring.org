                            <p>An important concept in trading financial securities (or cryptocurrencies) is order types. Broadly speaking, there are two types of orders: limit orders and market orders. We will dive into each, but the important concept to understand is that they represent a fundamental trade-off that any trader must make: what is more important for a specific trade — price, or immediacy?...</p>

                            <p>When we think of buying goods or services, we think of the price — the dollar cost. Similarly, when we think of trading financial assets, we measure their value in dollars, attaching a price to every security.</p>
                            <p>
                                What’s interesting to note is that in FX markets, we do not refer to the ‘costs’ as a price, but as an exchange rate...</p>

                            <p>Financial markets are enormously important in today’s societies, yet many of us don’t know or care how they ‘work’ — they’re just something that chugs along in the background.</p>

                            <p>The crypto markets are generally in the red, but Loopring (LRC) has overcome the generally downward direction to be trading at $0.70 and up 4.98% in 24 hours. The reason for this good performance amidst the general decline in the crypto markets is the announcement that LRC is now available for trading on the popular South Korean exchange, Bithumb...</p>
