                        <p class="animateMe">Loopring does not require users to send tokens to any party for custody. Tokens always remain in users' blockchain addresses during the whole trading/transaction life cycle. Loopring's orders do not lock user's asset, which means users can transfer tokens around even after orders have been submitted - Loopring will automatically adjust order's amount during settlement. Loopring protects users from threats such as exchange bankruptcies and hacking.</p>

                                <p>Loopring's generic design ensures it may be deployed on top of any public blockchains that have smart-contract support; it can also be integrated into blockchains as part of their native codebase. We have deployed Loopring on the Ethereum mainnet, and we are working on the NEO implementation.</p>

                                <p>Loopring provides higher liquidity and better price by matching orders in the form of order-rings. Each ring may consist of 2 to 16 orders, and tokens will be transferred atomically in a circular way during ring settlement.

                                    <br>
                                </p>Loopring is designed to provide matching-as-a-service, and its orders are unidirectional and do not differentiate takers and makers; Loopring's order-ring is a generalized model of trading-pair, it enables a built-in mechanism for performing arbitrage.

                                <h3>Order Sharing</h3>
                                <p>Loopring orders do not hold any tokens; thus they can be shared with as many relayers as possible. We encourage order sharing to speed up order-matching and avoid single point of failures.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>With order sharing, multiple relayers can form a consortium for building a shared liquidity pool to compete with established exchanges.The overall liquidity of Loopring-powered exchanges will be less fragmented.</p>

                                <p>Our patented "Dual Authoring" technology prevents orders and rings from being stolen by any middlemen or blockchain miners without binding orders to any dedicated relayers. The decoupling of orders from relayers makes orders genuinely sharable.</p>
