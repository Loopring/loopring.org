            <div class="title">Can Loopring do cross-chain token tradingï¼Ÿ</div>
            <div class="acc-holder">
                <p>Loopring is blockchain agnostic, meaning it can facilitate the trading of tokens on any smart contract capable public blockchains. But Loopring is not a cross-chain protocol. In order to perform cross-chain trading, tokenization services have to get involved to help issue asset-backed tokens on the target blockchain.</p>

            <div class="title">Loopring has issued LRC, LRN, and will probably issue LRQ. Will you issue a lot more LRx protocol tokens and will that dilute the value and lower the price of LRC?</div>
            <div class="acc-holder">
                <p>We have deployed Loopring on top of Ethereum and Qtum mainnet, and will deploy a version on top of NEO. In order to make Loopring's matching-as-a-service work, there has to be a token for each target blockchain to incentive different ecosystem roles.</p>
                <p>Going forward, we'll be even pickier in selecting target blockchains and will only deploy Loopring protocol on blockchains that have great potential and massive dApp adoptions. We are also working with selected public blockchain teams to integrate Loopring into their native codebase to avoid issuing a new token.</p>
                <p>Issuing new LRx tokens, however, will not dilute the value of LRC or any other LRx tokens, as each LRx token is unique to its underlying blockchain system and cannot be substituted by other LRx tokens. The value and price of a LRx token mostly depend on the value of its underlying blockchain ecosystem.</p>

            <div class="acc-holder">
                <p>Here at Loopring, we restrain ourselves from talking about the price of our tokens in public. We also pledge that we will not manipulate the price of our tokens.</p>

            <div class="title">How do you protect yourselves from copycats?</div>
            <div class="acc-holder">
                <p>We have filed multiple patents globally (including the US, EU, China, etc.) and will submit more patents soon. We will leverage these patents to fight against copycats and other copyright/patent infringements to protect ourselves and the interest of our token holders.</p>
                <p>Specifically, integrating Loopring into public blockchain will require formal patent authentication in writing from the Loopring Foundation.</p>

            <div class="title">What are the differences between Loopring, 0x, and Kyber?
            </div>
            <div class="acc-holder">
                <p>Loopring and 0x are protocols designed for order-based token trading, while Kyber is more of a market-making protocol. Both Loopring and 0x features off-chain order-management and on-chain settlement with atomic token swap. Loopring offers some unique features: 1) Loopring's Unidirectional Order Model doesn't differentiate takes and makers and makes its data modeling more generalized. 2) Loopring is designed with matching-as-a-service (MAAS) in mind, which lowers relayer's entrance barrier and enables trades to submit-and-forget their orders. 3) Loopring features ring-matching which provides better liquidity and optimized trading price. 4) Loopring's patented anti front-running technology protects relayers matching work. 5) Loopring Foundation offers more open-sourced software for potential ecosystem partners to adopt our solution with minimum cost. 6) We advocate relayers to share liquidities by joining in an order sharing mesh network instead of running isolated backends.</p>
                <p>
                    0x and Kyber are solid projects, and we believe the DEX market is big enough for all of us and even more protocols.

            <div class="title">Are you working with any centralized exchanges?
            </div>
            <div class="acc-holder">
                <p>We are not actively talking to centralized exchanges because they are not incentivized to adopt DEX and what Loopring offers indeed conflicts the way they make money.</p>
                <p>
                    One of our objectives is to transform non-custodial wallets into DEX'es. Therefore our priority is to work with wallets.

            <div class="acc-holder">
                <p>We are open to partner with any organizations globally as long as their involvement can accelerate the adoption of the Loopring Protocol and increase the demand for our LRx tokens.

            <div class="title">When will Loopring launch its own mainnet?
            </div>
            <div class="acc-holder">
                <p>
                    Loopring is a protocol thus does not have a mainnet to launch. We have deployed Loopring on Ethereum and Qtum.
